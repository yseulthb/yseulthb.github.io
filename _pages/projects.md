### Project 1: Mate preference and natural statistics in fish üêü
Behavioural experiments to understand how natural statistics influence mate preference in the Darter fish. <br>
Example of stimulus manipulation: creating different stimuli using a neural style transfer algorithm (Gatys et al. 2015).<br>
*Side project:* Meta-analysis of all the past Mendelson Lab's studies that investigate mate preference.

### Project 2: Attractiveness of visual patterns in humans üíª
Ongoing online experiment. Give it a try! <br>
It takes no more than 15 minutes and it's fun to do: http://isemsurvey.mbb.univ-montp2.fr/pattern/  <br>
You can also share the link with your friends!


### Former projects

##### Understanding how the primate brain processes tridimensional visual information that is extracted from binocular disparities (the small differences between the eye's projections of a visual scene that underlie binocular depth perception) üß†
A functional neuroimaging (fMRI) study was conducted to determine the brain areas that respond more strongly to natural motion-in-depth (temporal processing).<br>
In another one, we asked whether some brain areas would be more strongly activated when the subject perceives a stimulus with some properties that are more frequent in natural visual scenes. We showed surfaces slanted and tilted in depth to compare the different brain responses. 

*Technical developments:* Refinement of the estimation of the hemodynamic response function for several macaque subjects. Development of a pipeline to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI images using a principal component analysis (PCA) approach.
