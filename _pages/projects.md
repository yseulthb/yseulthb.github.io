### Project 1: Mate preference and natural statistics in fish üêü
We are designing and conducting several behavioural experiments to understand how natural statistics influence mate preference in the Darter fish (Etheostoma). <br>
The main idea relies on the principle that more frequent stimuli are easier (faster, more efficient) to process because the visual system has adapted to them. Could this 'ease' of processing some visual properties influence preference towards those properties? 
We use mate preference as a proxy to test this idea. For example, a potential mate whose appearance reflects to some extent the visual properties of their environment might be preferred over another mate that wouldn't or would less. This has interesting evolutionary implications in terms of mechanisms that could explain mate choice and/or mate preference.<br>

### Project 2: Mate preference in the darter fish, a within-lab meta-analysis üìà
We conducted a meta-analysis of all the past Mendelson Lab's studies that investigated the strength of preference for conspecifics over heterospecifics in darters. We wanted to have a better idea of the effect sizes and factors that might influence mate preference across studies. <br> 
Along with an effect size of medium strength, we found that both geographic relationships and genetic distance influence the strength of preference. We presented this work at the 2022 annual meeting of the Animal Behavior Society. You can have a look at our <a href="/pdf/Poster_ABS2022.pdf" target="_blank">[poster]</a> for more details.

### Project 3: Attractiveness of visual patterns in humans üíª
We have an ongoing online experiment. Give it a try! <br>
It takes no more than 15 minutes and it's fun to do! <br>

### Former projects and projects in the background

### Understanding how the primate brain processes tridimensional visual information that is extracted from binocular disparities üß† <br>
*Binocular disparities are the small differences between the eye's projections of a visual scene that underlie binocular depth perception*

We conducted a functional neuroimaging (fMRI) study in macaques üêí to identify brain areas that would respond more strongly to natural motion-in-depth compared to scrambled motion. We found a set of areas that we described in this <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/30/8/4528/5811848"> [paper]</a>. This highlighted the need to do more research involving 3D motion, as most studies on motion are done with planar or 2D motion, which limits our understanding of visual processing. <br><br>
In another fMRI study, we asked whether some brain areas would be more strongly activated when the subject perceives a stimulus that is made of visual properties that are more frequent in natural scenes. We showed surfaces that were either slanted or tilted in depth and compared brain responses to those different configurations. Our macaque subjects showed different responses, making the results difficult to interprete. We wondered whether the angle of the surface inclination we used should be more personalised to reflect individual differences. This requires testing the visual threshold of depth perception of our subjects using a psychophysics paradigm. Spoiler: This is a very long procedure and we are still collecting the data! In the meanwhile, we could already compare the data we obtained from one macaque subject to our human participants and, great news, they are similar!

*Technical developments:* Refinement of the estimation of the hemodynamic response function for several macaque subjects. Development of a pipeline to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI images using a principal component analysis (PCA) approach.
