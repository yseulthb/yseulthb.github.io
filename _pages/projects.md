### Project 1: Mate preference and natural statistics in fish üêü
Behavioural experiments to understand how natural statistics influence mate preference in the Darter fish. <br>
Example of stimulus manipulation: creating different stimuli using a neural style transfer algorithm (Gatys et al. 2015).<br>
*Side project:* Meta-analysis of all the past Mendelson Lab's studies that investigate mate preference.

### Project 2: Attractiveness of visual patterns in humans üíª
Ongoing online experiment. Give it a try! <br>
It takes no more than 15 minutes and it's fun to do: http://isemsurvey.mbb.univ-montp2.fr/pattern/  <br>

### Understanding how the primate brain processes tridimensional visual information that is extracted from binocular disparities (the small differences between the eye's projections of a visual scene that underlie binocular depth perception) üß†
We conducted a functional neuroimaging (fMRI) study in macaques üêí to identify brain areas that would respond more strongly to natural motion-in-depth compared to scrambled motion. We found a set of areas that we described in this <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/30/8/4528/5811848"> [paper]</a>. This highlighted the need to do more research involving 3D motion, as most studies on motion are done with planar or 2D motion, less ecologically relevant. <br><br>
In another fMRI study, we asked whether some brain areas would be more strongly activated when the subject perceives a stimulus that is made of visual properties that are more frequent in natural scenes. We showed surfaces slanted and tilted in depth and compared brain responses to those different configuations. Our macaque subjects showed different responses, making the results difficult to interprete. We wondered whether the angle of the surface inclination we used should be more personalised to reflect individual differences. This requires testing the visual threshold of depth perception of our subjects using a psychophysics paradigm. Spoiler: This is a very long procedure and we are still collecting the data! In the meanwhile, we could already compare the data we obtained from one macaque subject to our human participants and, great news, they are similar! Check the poster we presented at the Predictive Brain Conference to know more: <a href="/pdf/Poster_Marseille.pdf" target="_blank">[Poster]</a>.<br><br>
*Technical developments:* Refinement of the estimation of the hemodynamic response function for several macaque subjects. Development of a pipeline to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI images using a principal component analysis (PCA) approach.
