I am a PhD student in cognitive neuroscience at the [Brain and Cognition Research Center (CerCo)](http://cerco.ups-tlse.fr/-Presentation-), in Toulouse, France. I am also a teaching assistant in the department of Neuroscience and Behaviour at Paul Sabatier University (Toulouse 3).

The aim of my PhD work is to understand how primate visual system adapts to spatial regularities in the visual environment and more specifically how the brain encodes 3D properties.
