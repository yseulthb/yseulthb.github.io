## Research and Teaching

### Academic positions
* 2020 - Ongoing: **Postdoctoral researcher**, Centre d'Ecologie Fonctionnelle et Evolutive - [CEFE](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/) (CNRS, University of Montpellier), Montpellier, France. Supervisors: Julien Renoult, CNRS researcher and Tamra Mendelson, Professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (Department of Biological Sciences).

* 2015-2020: **PhD studies in Cognitive Neuroscience**, Université Paul Sabatier and [CerCo](http://cerco.cnrs.fr/en/cerco-umr5549-2/) (CNRS), Toulouse, France. Supervisor: Benoit Cottereau, CNRS researcher. <br />
Title of the thesis: Spatial and temporal integration of binocular disparities in primates. [[Manuscript]](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02956425v1) <br>
*My PhD project aimed to provide a better understanding of how the visual system in primates processes binocular disparities (underlying depth perception) in space and time. I also investigated the relationship between the 3D properties of the environment and neural responses. I mostly conducted functional neuroimaging studies in macaque, and I collected psychophysics measurements in human and macaque to give insight into the link between visual perception, natural statistics, and brain activity.*<br />
