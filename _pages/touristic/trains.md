# It's all about trains!

<img src="/assets/images/trains.jpg" alt="Train"> 

I tend to like train trips a lot and have gathered a bunch of information and tips that I thought might be of fair use for others, too. <br>

### Tips & Tricks

- A great website that gathers a huge amount of information on train travel in Europe and the world, sorted by countries and cities: [seat61.com](https://www.seat61.com/)  <br>
It also provides alternative roads and touristic information.

- A wonderful book about travelling across Europe by train, with a suggestion of trips and alternative railways + its complementary website: [Europe by rail](https://www.europebyrail.eu/about-the-book/) -> Slow travel. 

- Websites from which to order cheap train tickets: <br>
[trainline.eu](https://www.trainline.eu/) <br>
[raileurope.co.uk](https://raileurope.co.uk/) (formerly loco2)

- To help you find alternative transportation in case train tickets are too expensive or non-existent: 
[rome2rio.com](https://www.rome2rio.com/)
