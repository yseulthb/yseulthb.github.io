# South of Spain and Portugal by train

We started the journey from Toulouse, via Latour Carol/Entveigt (a bit longer but cheaper as this route uses regional trains instead of high-speed trains that are usualy more expensive), Barcelona and Madrid. Another way is to go through Alcazar de San Juan instead of Madrid. Unfortunately we could not make it as trains were all full to go to the Don Quijote city: Carnival was happening at the same time and we were not quick enough to book our tickets!
