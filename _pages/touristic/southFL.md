Following a scientific conference held at St Pete Beach near the city of Tampa in the middle of Florida, we planned a one-week road trip to explore the south of Florida, from Miami, to the Everglades, to the Keys. <br>
As we were 6, we mostly privileged airbnb accomodations but also spent a few nights in nice resorts.

# Miami
Despite being the sixth most densely populated (1) city in the US, we did not feel overwhelmed at all as the atmosphere was pretty chilled.
## The Wynwood district
Street art and arts https://wynwoodmiami.com/
## Art Deco District (Ocean Drive)
Art Deco houses are to be seen near and on Ocean Drive. Lots of pubs, bars, and clubs in front of the ocean make this district very party-oriented.
## Little Havana District
Ball & Chain Bar (https://ballandchainmiami.com/)
## The metromover
Ride the entire Metromover (free!): https://www.miamidade.gov/global/transportation/metromover.page 
You'll see the Downtown part of Miami with its huge skyscrappers!

# The Everglades
The Everglades is a national parc where you can observe crocodiles and alligators. It is located approximately 1.5 hours away from Downtown Miami, depending on traffic. <br>

Open 365 days a year, the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center is open daily until 5 p.m. (entrance fee = 30$ per vehicle): https://www.nps.gov/ever/index.htm 


# The Keys

The Keys are a complex of several islands at the tip of Florida, linked by several big bridges. There are lots of beaches and cocconut trees along the road from Miami.
The Keys are in between Florida and the island of Cuba.
We headed to Key West, the last (4 hour drive from Miami) but nicest of the islands and spent the night on a sailing boat.
