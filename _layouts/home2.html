<p align="justify">Hi, welcome to my website! <br />
      I am a postdoc at the <a href="https://biology.umbc.edu/">Department of Biological Sciences</a> of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), in Baltimore, MD (USA). There I work on signal design in the darter fish (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etheostomatinae"><em>Etheosomatidae</em></a>) with <a href="https://www.mendelsonlab.net/">Tamra Mendelson</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://www.eevcom-montpellier.com/julien-renoult.html">Julien Renoult</a> in Montpellier, France where I spent the first year of my postdoc. The idea is to use artificial neural networks to create novel stimuli that mimic natural statistics to better understand the evolution of pattern preferences and signal design (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>/efficient coding framework). Besides this project, I also explore the link between visual attractiveness and camouflage patterns.<br />
      Before that postdoc, I completed my PhD studies in cognitive neuroscience at the <a href="http://cerco.cnrs.fr/">Brain and Cognition Research Center (CerCo)</a>, in Toulouse, France. <br />My PhD project aimed to investigate how the primate visual system processes binocular disparities (underlying depth perception) in space and time. I also explored the relationship between the 3D properties of the environment and neural responses. I mostly conducted functional neuroimaging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging">(fMRI)</a> studies in the macaque. But I also collected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics">psychophysics</a> measurements in human and macaque to give insight into the link between visual perception, natural statistics, and brain activity.<br /><br />
      In a more general way, I am interested in understanding and studying how the sensory systems and cognitive functions of different species are shaped by or adapted to the environment in which they evolve (sensory and cognitive ecology). <br /><br />As a future researcher / young scientist, I am concerned by how science is done, may it be regarding empirical methods, statistical analyses, access to material and data, or growing competition among scientists. In an attempt to foster discussions on slow and open science, I am part of a recently formed collective structure with other young researchers: <a href="https://twitter.com/SlowpenScience/">Slowpen Science</a>. <i>We organised a <a href="https://sold21.sciencesconf.org/">conference</a> in July in Nantes, France!</i> At a bigger scale, I became an ambassador for the Center for Open Science (<a href="https://cos.io/our-communities/become-ambassador/">COS</a>). <br />
      Another aspect of science that matters to me is to meet with the general public. I try to get involved in actions and events promoting the popularisation of science (articles and talks to the great audience, <a href="https://pintofscience.fr/mondial/">Pint of Science</a>, <a href="http://www.esof.eu/en/">ESOF</a>, <a href="https://www.echosciences-sud.fr/">Echosciences</a>..) and I am also part of <a href="http://incognu.fr/">InCOGnu</a> and <a href="https://federationfresco.fr/">Fresco</a>, two organisation gathering students and young researchers in cognitive science at a regional and a national level, respectively.<br /><br /> You'll find additional details in the different sections above!</p>
