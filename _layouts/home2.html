<h2>Welcome on board!</h2>

I am a PhD student (4th year) in cognitive neuroscience at the Brain and Cognition Research Center (CerCo), in Toulouse, France. <br />
You'll find more details about me and about my research in the different sections above!
<!-- p>You'll find on this blog different kind of things, mostly blog posts and some pictures. <br />
My interests range from food to science popularisation, from broad science questions to gardening practices, without any logical link between those different topics. <br />
I hope you'll enjoy reading some bits as much as I painfully enjoyed writing them!</p>

<p>You'll also find some information on my research that I try to keep updated. <p/> -->
