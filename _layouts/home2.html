<h2>About me</h2>

      <img src="/assets/images/header.jpg" alt="Welcome!"> <br />

<br />

I am currently finishing my PhD studies in cognitive neuroscience at the <a href="http://cerco.ups-tlse.fr/-Presentation-">Brain and Cognition Research Center (CerCo)</a>, in Toulouse, France. I was also a teaching assistant during the first 3 years of my PhD in the department of Neuroscience and Behaviour at Paul Sabatier University - Toulouse 3 and I will be teaching in the department of Psychology during the 2020 Winter semester at the Université Jean-Jaurès-Toulouse 2. <br />
The aim of my PhD project is to provide a better understanding of how the visual system in primates processes binocular disparities (underlying depth perception) in space and time. I also investigate the relationship between the 3D properties of the environment and neural responses. I mostly conduct functional neuroimaging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging">(fMRI)</a> studies in macaque and collect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics">psychophysics</a> measurements in human and macaque to give insight into the link between visual perception, natural statistics, and the brain activity.<br />
<br />
As a future researcher / young scientist, I am concerned by how science is done, may it be regarding empirical methods, statistical analyses, access to material and data, or growing competition among scientists. 
In an attempt to foster discussions on slow and open science I am part of a recently formed collective with other young researchers: <a href="https://twitter.com/SlowpenScience/">The Slowpen Science Lab</a>. At a bigger scale, I became an ambassador for the Center for Open Science (<a href="https://cos.io/our-communities/become-ambassador/">COS</a>). <br/>  
I am also interested in ethics, scientific scepticism, and critical thinking and believe that we should teach people about those topics much more than it is currently done. <br />
<br />
Another aspect of science that really matters to me is to share it with the great audience. I try to get involved in actions and events promoting the popularisation of science (articles and talks to the great audience, <a href="https://pintofscience.fr/mondial/">Pint of Science</a>, <a href="http://www.esof.eu/en/">ESOF</a>, <a href="https://www.echosciences-sud.fr/">Echosciences</a>..) and I am also part of <a href="http://incognu.fr/">InCOGnu</a>, an organisation gathering students and young researchers in cognitive science.<br />
<br />
Finally, because there is more than just hard working in life, I like taking care of my plants and spending time thinking about the different forms of urban agriculture and how the natural environment and ecological concerns can play a role in urbanism and in our everyday life.<br />

<!-- The aim of the blog section is to address those different topics in a very informal way, sharing my thoughts and discussing different points of view. -->
<br />

You'll find additional details in the different sections above!
<!-- p>You'll find on this blog different kind of things, mostly blog posts and some pictures. <br />
My interests range from food to science popularisation, from broad science questions to gardening practices, without any logical link between those different topics. <br />
I hope you'll enjoy reading some bits as much as I painfully enjoyed writing them!</p>

<p>You'll also find some information on my research that I try to keep updated. <p/> -->
