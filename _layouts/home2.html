<h2>About me</h2>

      <img src="/assets/images/header.jpg" alt="Welcome!"> <br />

<br />

 <p align="justify">I am currently finishing my PhD studies in cognitive neuroscience at the <a href="http://cerco.cnrs.fr/">Brain and Cognition Research Center (CerCo)</a>, in Toulouse, France. This semester I am also teaching in the department of Psychology at the University of Toulouse (Université Toulouse Jean-Jaurès), France. <br />
The aim of my PhD project was to provide a better understanding of how the visual system in primates processes binocular disparities (underlying depth perception) in space and time. I also investigated the relationship between the 3D properties of the environment and neural responses. I mostly conducted functional neuroimaging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging">(fMRI)</a> studies in macaque and collected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics">psychophysics</a> measurements in human and macaque to give insight into the link between visual perception, natural statistics, and the brain activity.<br />
For my next research projects, I aim to dive into the fields of sensory ecology and cognitive ecology to further investigate how sensory systems and cognitive functions of different species are shaped by or adapted to the environment in which they evolve. <br />
<br />
As a future researcher / young scientist, I am concerned by how science is done, may it be regarding empirical methods, statistical analyses, access to material and data, or growing competition among scientists. 
In an attempt to foster discussions on slow and open science I am part of a recently formed collective with other young researchers: <a href="https://twitter.com/SlowpenScience/">Slowpen Science</a>. At a bigger scale, I became an ambassador for the Center for Open Science (<a href="https://cos.io/our-communities/become-ambassador/">COS</a>). <br/>  
I am also interested in ethics, scientific scepticism, and critical thinking and believe that we should teach people about those topics much more than it is currently done. <br />
<br />
Another aspect of science that really matters to me is to share it with the great audience. I try to get involved in actions and events promoting the popularisation of science (articles and talks to the great audience, <a href="https://pintofscience.fr/mondial/">Pint of Science</a>, <a href="http://www.esof.eu/en/">ESOF</a>, <a href="https://www.echosciences-sud.fr/">Echosciences</a>..) and I am also part of <a href="http://incognu.fr/">InCOGnu</a>, an organisation gathering students and young researchers in cognitive science.<br />
<br />
Finally, because there is more than just hard working in life, I like taking care of my plants and spending time thinking about the different forms of urban agriculture and how the natural environment and ecological concerns can play a role in urbanism and in our everyday life.<br />

<!-- The aim of the blog section is to address those different topics in a very informal way, sharing my thoughts and discussing different points of view. -->
