I. The problem<br>
Oh, t is large and p is small<br>
That’s why we are walking tall.<br>
What it means we need not mull<br>
Just so we reject the null.<br>
Or chi-square large and p near nil<br>
Results like that, they fill the bill.<br>
What if meaning requires a poll?<br>
Never mind, we’re on a roll!<br>
The message we have learned too well?<br>
Significance! That rings the bell!<br>

II. The implications<br>
The moral of our little tale?<br>
That we mortals may be frail<br>
When we feel a p near zero<br>
Makes us out to be a hero.<br>
But tell us then is it too late?<br>
Can we perhaps avoid our fate?<br>
Replace that wish to null-reject<br>
Report the size of the effect.<br>
That may not insure our glory<br>
But at least it tells a story<br>
That is just the kind of yield<br>
Needed to advance our field.<br>

Robert Rosenthal, 1991<br>
