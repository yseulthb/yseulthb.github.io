A couple of random facts to know when following a plant-based diet.

I didn't think about writing a post on that specific topic until recently while having a chat on a related topic with some friends.
It appeared that we do not actually know much about nutrition.
I think this is a very important topic, and especially when you follow a non meat-based diet as most nutritional advice are based on a diet that includes meat or fish intake.

Getting more and more interested into basic nutrition, here are some facts that I find necesary to be aware of (you'll find references at the end of the post): 

- <strong> Plant proteins are more easily absorbed if you combine them with cereals </strong> <br>
This is because proteins from plants lack two molecules at the end of their amino acid chain (which is what a protein is made of). The intake of cereals helps the body to absorb the plant proteins 
-  *Avoid having tea or coffee after a meal* <br>
Even though caffein is of great help for digestion and for keeping you alert, it also has side effects
The caffein will slow down your body ability to absorb minerals such as iron, magnesium, zinc or calcium.*
- <strong> After sport, add some salt to your water </strong> <br>
The salt will favour your body homeostasis
- <strong> Consider supplying yourself in iodine </strong> <br>
Mostly found in sea animals and sea plants, and to a less extent in dairy products, iodine plays a huge role in thyroid regulation, being a component of thyroid hormones (this information always reminds me of those iodine tabs you get when there is a nuclear hazard). Nowadays, salt is also enriched in iodine, but not systematically. This measure has helped by lots to reduce the ocurance of iodine deficiency.
Apparently it has been shown that soya might prevent the absorption of iodine at some levels. 

The risk of a deficiency in iodine are plurals: a delay in body growth, mental disorders, an abnormally functionning thyroid (gloitre / enlargement of the thyroid), impacts on the fetus, congenital hypothyroidism (also called cretinism)

"The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men ages 18 and older the PRI is set at 150 μg/day. PRI for pregnancy or lactation 200 μg/day. For children ages 1–17 years the PRIs increase with age from 90 to 130 μg/day. (Wikipedia) "
