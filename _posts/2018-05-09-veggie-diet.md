A couple of things to know when following a plant-based diet.

I didn't think about doing a post on that specific topic till I discussed with some friends recently.
It appeared that we do not actually know much about nutrition.
I think this is a very important topic, and especially when you follow a non meat-based diet as most nutritional advice are based on a diet that includes meat or fish intake.

Getting more and more interested into basic nutrition, here are some facts that I find necesary to be aware of:
- Plant proteins are more easily absorbed if you combine them with cereals <br>
This is because proteins from plants lack two molecules at the end of their amino acid chain (which is what a protein is made of). The intake of cereals helps the body to absorb the plant proteins 
- Avoid having tea or coffee after a meal <br>
The coffein will prevent your body from absorbing some nutriens such as iron
- After sport, add some salt to your water <br>
The salt will favour your body homeostasis
