Whilst I was cycling along the canal coming back from the lab, I noticed several trees that were already at an advanced stage of their flowering.
I remember finding it quite puzzling since we were still in the first half of the month of February, but this didn't prevent my mind from jumping to a different topic.

A couple of days later, I happened to be taking the same path and this time I stopped to identify the trees: Prunus mahaleb, a very common variety of trees in this region of the world.
I then checked the usual flowering time of those trees and found out that despite a known variability in the flowering time of that species, they usually start blossoming from mid-March onwards, until late April, beginning of May.

Today is still February and I noticed those trees about 2 weeks ago. It thus seems that those trees are flowering about one month earlier than they used to do, as described in the litterature.
