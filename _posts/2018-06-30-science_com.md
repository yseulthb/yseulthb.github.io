After reading Simine Vazire's blogpost about what it means to be a scientist, I could only ask myself the same question.
While she's proposing an Oath for Scientists, describing good research practices in order to protect science 
credibility, which are undoubtedly to be followed, I cannot not think about what else being a good scientist means.
As she's talking about the credibility of science among scientists themselves and their responsibility as regards to 
their profession, there is an obvious link that popped out in my head but found no echo in her saying: 
What about the credibility of science as conceived by non scientists?
And this is the point I want to further develop.
