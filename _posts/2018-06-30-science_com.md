After reading [Simine Vazire's blogpost](http://sometimesimwrong.typepad.com/wrong/2018/01/oath-for-scientists.html) about what it means to be a scientist, I could only ask myself the same question.
While she's proposing an Oath for Scientists, describing good research practices in order to protect science 
credibility, which are undoubtedly to be followed, I cannot not think about what else being a good scientist means.
As she's talking about the credibility of science among scientists themselves and their responsibility as regards to 
their profession, there is an obvious link that popped out in my head but found no echo in her saying: 
What about the credibility of science as conceived by non scientists?
And this is the point I want to further develop. 

There's no doubt scientists should be the first concerned by the credibility of science.
However, I do believe that this necessarily goes along with the general public's good understanding of what science is, and whether
they can trust it or not. 
Obviously trusting science is not the right term to use but that's the very point of it. 
People from outside science should be educated/taught about how to understand science, and how to develop their critical thinking.
Science is not a truth but is a process. What was true at a given time might be proven wrong at any other time, and the reverse
works as well. 
Sadly enough, too often scientific data or results are misinterpreted. And although scientists do oversell their findings, being precautious regarding data interpretation won't prevent people to misunderstanding a point. Media for example like very much to use appealing article headers that often turn out to make a point that is outside the scope of the study they're refering to. 
Instead of being crossed with the media, I believe it would be much more effective if scientists took the time to make their findings accessible to someone who is not in their field.
And this is another point that is reached as well: the fact that even scientists if they're not in the field, could easily fall into this misinterpretation abyss. 

I think it should be among every scientist's duties to share their work with non specialists, to take time to make their findings understandable by most people. May it be through events of science popularisation - there are now plenty of options, from the traditional conference to the pint of science format, through the redaction of blogposts or more formal articles in newspapers for example, through a collaborative work to write a general book about science advances of a field, and so on.
