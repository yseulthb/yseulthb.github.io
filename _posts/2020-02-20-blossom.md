Whilst I was cycling along the canal coming back from the lab, I noticed several trees that were already at an advanced stage of their flowering.
I remember finding it quite puzzling since we were still in the first half of the month of February, but this didn't prevent my mind from jumping to a different topic.

A couple of days later, I happened to be taking the same path and this time I stopped to identify the trees: Prunus mahaleb, a very common variety of trees in this region of the world.
I then checked the usual flowering time of those trees and found out that despite a known variability in the flowering time of that species, they usually start blossoming from mid-March onwards, until late April, beginning of May.

Today is still February and I noticed those trees about 2 weeks ago. It thus seems that those trees are flowering about one month earlier than they used to do, as described in the litterature.

I started paying more attention to the usual early signs of Spring time and could notice an increased number of birds chirping. 
If I hadn't taken the time to check the tree flowering time, I would only have a fuzzy feeling of a little thing getting a bit wrong. 
But now, I can notice, feel, hear, see that things are changing, that Spring is coming more early. Temperatures in February were unusually high. Trees are flowering earlier. I guess birds will start reproducing earlier.
I've read somewhere that the changing gradient is faster for animal species than for vegetal species. And that the Alps are a very good example of global warming at a big scale, because there, the effects of global warming are more striking than in the valley.

Today I feel sad.
