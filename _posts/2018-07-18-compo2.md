My heart is bleeding
Everytime I'm thinking
About
What happened
And I can still hear you say
Let's pretend
Nothing really ever happened
But I can't get rid
Of this hateful feeling
It's everywhere in my mind,
In my soul and my skin
How could I pretend?

How could I pretend
That I don't hate you
For what you've done to me
In the name of fun
And in your drunkenness
