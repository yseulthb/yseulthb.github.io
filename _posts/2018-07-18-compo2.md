My heart is bleeding <br>
Everytime I'm thinking <br>
About <br>
What happened <br>
And I can still hear you say <br>
Let's pretend <br>
Nothing really ever happened <br>
But I can't get rid <br>
Of this hateful feeling <br>
It's everywhere in my mind, <br>
In my soul and my skin <br>
How could I pretend? <br>
<br>
How could I pretend <br>
That I don't hate you <br>
For what you've done to me <br>
In the name of fun <br>
And in your drunkenness <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
